# Patch notes

This is a test Patch note

It should parse just fine

`this is a simple code string`

**this is supposed to be bold**

_this is supposed to be italic_

**_this is supposed to be bold and italic_**

the parser should be able to mix **bold**, _italic_, **_bold and italic_**, `code` and ~stroke~ text in the same line

- this is a list item
- this is another list item

here it should display the number three {{myNumber}} and keep on parsing just fine
